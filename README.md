# War of City-States

This is an HTML 5 game I am making using the `<canvas>` element, [jquery](http://jquery.com) and [oCanvas](http://ocanvas.org).
Everything else unless specified was made by me.

## Objective

The objective depends on which mode you are playing:
+ **Infinite** - play for as long as you can
+ **Arcade** - beat all 10 levels
+ **Militant** - conquer everybody
+ **Rebellion** - put down the rebelling city-states
+ **Survival** - survive as long as you can
